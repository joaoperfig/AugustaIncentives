The following SQL queries were executed and returned these results:

{query_output}

You now have the query results. You have two options:

1. **REPLY TO USER**: Provide a human-readable interpretation of these results, explaining what the data shows and answering the user's original question: "{original_user_message}"

2. **DO ANOTHER QUERY**: If you need more information to fully answer the user's question, you can write additional SQL queries to gather more data.

**Instructions:**
- If you choose to REPLY TO USER: Provide a clear, conversational explanation of the results. Do NOT include any SQL queries in your response.
- If you choose to DO ANOTHER QUERY: Write your additional SQL queries in ```sql code blocks. You can also provide context about why you need more information.

**Current iteration: {iteration_count}/{max_iterations}**
